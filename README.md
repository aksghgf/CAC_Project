Project Title: CAC Optimizer Pro: The ML-Powered Ad Automation Platform
 1. Problem Statement
 Businesses often pay high fees to ad agencies to handle digital marketing campaigns‚Äîespecially Meta
 and Google Ads‚Äîbecause of the agencies‚Äô expertise in targeting, budgeting, and optimization.
 However, this results in:
 ‚Ä¢ 
‚Ä¢ 
‚Ä¢ 
‚Ä¢ 
Lack of control and transparency for business owners
 No centralized visibility on CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
 High dependency on human expertise, limiting scale
 Difficulty comparing CAC across influencer, billboard, email, and ad platforms
 There‚Äôs a lack of an intelligent product that can eliminate the middleman (agency) and give founders full
 control over ad spend optimization, campaign execution, and real-time CAC insights.
 2. Project Idea & Objective
 What it will do:
 CAC Optimizer Pro is a full-stack (MERN) product with machine learning at its core. It empowers
 business owners to:
 üß† Main USP: Replace the Agency Middleman Using ML

Input campaign goals, budget, and audience
 Use ML to decide targeting, budget split, copy, platform (Meta/Google)
 Launch Meta Ads directly through Meta Ads API (no agency needed)
 Auto-optimize based on real-time CAC feedback
 üí° Business owners typically spend 15‚Äì30% of their ad budget on agencies. CAC
 Optimizer Pro eliminates this cost by automating strategic tasks ‚Äî saving lakhs annually.

While the ML model handles strategy, targeting, and CAC optimization,
 A Campaign Success Manager (CSM) monitors campaign trends across clients
 The CSM ensures:
 Communication with business owners when needed
 Intervention if CAC trends rise unexpectedly
 Strategy review when machine-driven performance flattens
 This builds trust and provides the human communication layer without needing a full agency
 team
